From the biggest Hungarian real estate site (ingatlan.com) the data is downloaded with BS4.
Error handling built in, because some of the ad are out of date in the minute of the code running. 

Because parsing such big ammount of data could cause some problems on the site, sleep timers are added to the code.

The "Terms and Conditions" of the page strictly forbids to use parsing solutions on the page, the test run was succesfull, but had to stop it after a few trials.

The data wich was downloaded from the page as test was deleted.
